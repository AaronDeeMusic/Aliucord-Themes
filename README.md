My Aliucord Themes

Contains all the themes i've made for the custom discord client known as Aliucord.

Client modifications are against Discordâ€™s Terms of Service.

However, Discord is pretty indifferent about them and there are no known cases of users getting banned for using client mods! 

Regardless, if your account is very important to you and it getting disabled would be a disaster for you, you should probably not use any client mods (not exclusive to Aliucord), just to be safe

Additionally, make sure not to post screenshots with themes active in a server where you might get banned for it
